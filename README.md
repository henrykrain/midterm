# Birthday Reminder Web Application

## Introduction
The Birthday Reminder Web Application is designed to help those with busy schedules or those who simply have a hard time remembering important dates keep track of all the birthdays that matter to them. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app offers a user-friendly interface to add, view, edit, and delete birthday information with ease.

## Features
- **Add Birthdays**: Enter the name and date of birth using a simple form and submit it to add the birthday to your list.
- **View Birthdays**: All added birthdays are displayed in a neatly organized list that's easy to navigate.
- **Edit Birthdays**: Made a mistake or need to update a date? Click the edit button next to any entry to open a modal where you can make changes.
- **Delete Birthdays**: If an entry is no longer needed, easily remove it from your list with the delete option.

## Future Development
Future development hopes to include the addition of a astrological sign graphic and even a compatibility to the user's astrological sign. Also, an algorithm that sorts birthdays on relevancy. 

## Usage
1. **Adding a Birthday**: Fill in the name and date of birth in the form at the top of the page and click `Submit`.
2. **Editing a Birthday**: Click the `Edit` button next to any entry to open the editing modal. Make your changes and click `Save Changes`.
3. **Deleting a Birthday**: Click the `Delete` button next to any entry you wish to remove.
